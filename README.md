Simple JavaFX application simulating dice rolls. ðŸŽ²

I wrote this application to learn JavaFX (thanks, Bucky!) as my first GUI. It took about 2 days of work to learn and write.

- The left "dice box" list shows common dice in dice notation. Click on one to make it the active die.
- Clicking "roll" rolls the die. The big center number is the roll. The small text below is status text.
- The right "history" list shows the past rolls. Selecting the numbers provides a sum of that subset.
- The left status bar shows the number of rolls so far (and the number of rolls selected, if any)
- The right status bar shows the sum of all the rolls (and the sum of the selected subset, if any)
- "Clear" clears the history, number of rolls, and sums.
- "Sort" sorts the history from largest to smallest, making choosing the best roll or dropping the worst rolls easy.
